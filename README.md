# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Description
This project focuses on cleaning and tidying data collected from a smartphone accelerometer. I merged testing and training datasets, split the data by subject and activity, and calculated the average of 66 means and stand deviations of the related data for each subject and activity type. Te steps for this can be found in the run_analysis.R file.

## Installation
For this project I used the "reshape2" package.
