# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Description
This project focuses on cleaning and tidying data collected from a smartphone accelerometer. 

The run_analysis.R scipt:
1. Merges testing and training datasets
2. Subsets the dataset so that the dataset only contains measurements of the means and standard deviations of measurements
3. Creates a dataset which includes the average of 66 means and standard deviations of measurements for each of 30 subjects during 6 activities
4. Appropriately and meaningfully assigns labels and variable names to the dataset

## Installation
For this project I used the "reshape2" package.
